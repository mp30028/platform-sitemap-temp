## Updating the file manually
To update the file replace the existing file located at `/mnt/volume-swot-docker/swot-files/api-storage/sitemap.xml.current-sitemap.UPLOADED`<br/>
Privileged access (sudo) is required to update the file<br/>
Once the pipelines are in place updating manually should be avoided.<br/>
