## Where should XML Sitemap be placed?
The XML Sitemap should be accessible with a dedicated URL, usually http(s)://mydomain.com/sitemap.xml and it's recommended to follow this convention.
If for some reason a different location or filename has to be used then this has to be mapped with a Sitemap-directive in robots.txt 

e.g `Sitemap: http://www.example.com/alternativelocation/alternativefilename.xml`
